    <h1>Citizenship</h1>
    <img src="citizenship.jpg">
    <br>
    <body> I believe that honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage
       are necessary components of good citizenship. These qualities are important
       for interacting and getting along with people in your surroundings
      <h2>What they mean:</h2c>
    <p> Citizenship: the character of an individual viewed as a member of society; behavior
       in terms of the duties, obligations, and functions of a citizen. This quality is important in the
       world that you live in because it is a big part of who you are. </p>
    <p> Compassion: sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others. This quality can help to read people's feelings and figure out solutions to issues.</p>
    <p> Respect: a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements. This quality is important because it helps to understand people's boundaries and values as well as your own.</p>
    <p> Responisbility: the state or fact of having a duty to deal with something or of having control over someone. Responsibility <p/>
    <p> Courage: the ability to do something that frightens one.</p>
    <p> Another very important part of being a citizen is being able to share. In a community, sharing is necessary bceuase some recources are public and meant to be used for everyone.
      It is necessary to insure that those recoources are available for everyone.</p>
    <h3>The most recent act of citizenship that I witnessed was when I complimented someone on their clothing.
      This is an act of citizenship because it shows the respect and caring I have for my peers.</h3>
